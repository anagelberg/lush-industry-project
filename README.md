## :thinking: Problem Space

Our vision is to:

-   Develop an in-house POS System leveraging open-source technology.
-   Champion the use of Green Energy in retail.
-   Enhance the shopping experience for customers and staff alike.

Challenge: How can we create an open-source, innovative shopping experience that keeps pace with market evolution and exemplifies digital ethics?

## :telescope: Research Highlights

[We explored the following to create our solution](https://www.figma.com/proto/Ic4daqApOkd7Bxvc9Fy4F0/Hackathon?page-id=23%3A102&type=design&node-id=75-179&viewport=833%2C-715%2C0.16&t=qPrcQlAWxDHWvHrT-1&scaling=contain&mode=design):

-   Customer feelings about waiting in line.
-   Trends in self-checkout and the usage of LUSH Lens.

##  :mag: LUSH Lens Technology

Lush Lens, an image recognition technology by LUSH, is at the forefront of ethical tech in retail. It promptly provides product information and is built with respect for digital ethics in partnership with Saelor.

> "I strongly believe LUSH Lens has the potential to revolutionize the packaging industry, even eliminate it" 
> -- Mark Constantine, LUSH Co-founder

Stats show:

-   75% of consumers enjoy a better shopping experience with LUSH Lens.
-   47% prefer cashier-less services.
-   53% are in favor of self-checkout.
-   50% reduction in product packaging.

Current Challenge: Reliance on manual till operations for checkout, as LUSH lens only supports online orders, not in-store shopping.
