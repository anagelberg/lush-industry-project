This app was built for a 24 hour hackathon through BrainStation & Partnered with Lush. The team consisted of UX/UI designers Grace Lee and Ning Tao, Data Scientists John Narvaez and Quentin Parrenin, and Web Developers Elise Li and Amy Nagelberg. 

The submitted site can be viewed here: https://lush-industry-project.netlify.app/ or by scanning the barcode below. Please note due to time contraints, this proof of concept (and especially camera configuration) was developed for mobile use only, as that is the prototype's primary intended purpose.
