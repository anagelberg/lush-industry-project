This app was built for a 24 hour hackathon through BrainStation & Partnered with Lush and won first place. üèÜ

The team consisted of UX/UI designers Grace Lee and Ning Tao, Data Scientists John Narvaez and Quentin Parrenin, and Web Developers Elise Li and Amy Nagelberg. 

The goal of this project was to create an innovative point-of-sale system to replace existing in-store hardware using open source resources only. For our solution, we decided to demonstrate how LUSH lens could be repurposed for in-store shopping experience (where currently it only works for online orders). 

The submitted site can be viewed here: https://lush-industry-project.netlify.app/ or by scanning the barcode below. The idea behind this prototype is that in-store customers would scan a QR code in a given store to link them to that particular store's website. Please note due to time contraints, this proof of concept (and especially camera configuration) was developed for mobile use only, as that is the prototype's primary intended purpose.
